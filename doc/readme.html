    <h1>RealRand - Generate real random numbers with Ruby.</h1>
    <!-- #MENU# -->
    <div id="Content">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      A lot of algorithms in cryptography etc. depend on good random numbers,
      i.e. random numbers that are "real" random and not just generated by a
      so called pseudo-random generator.
      </p>
      <p>
      You cannot create real random numbers using a computer and an algorithm.
      Only nature creates real randomness (just take a look around the next
      time you are surrounded by a group of people.).
      </p>
      <p>
      Real randomness occurs e.g. in atmospheric noise, during radioactive
      decay, or in a lava lamp. Fortunately, you do not have to listen to an
      old radio the whole day or, even worse, deposit some uranium in your
      living room and observe it with a Geiger-Müller tube. Other people do so
      (in a slightly modified manner, of course) and they kindly make their
      results public.
      </p>
      <p>
      There are at least the following web sites, that offer real random
      numbers for free:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.random.org">http://www.random.org</a> - 
        Real random numbers are generated from atmospheric noise on this site.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits">http://www.fourmilab.ch/hotbits</a> -
        The HotBits generator creates real random numbers by timing successive
        pairs of radioactive decays detected by a Geiger-Müller tube
        interfaced to a computer.</li>
        <li><a href="http://random.hd.org">http://random.hd.org</a> - 
        "This system gathers its 'entropy' or truely random noise from a
        number of sources, including local processes, files and devices, Web
        page hits and remote Web sites."</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      All these real random numbers can be requested via different HTTP
      interfaces that all look very similar. E.g. you can request a number of
      random bytes from any of the web sites above.
      </p>
      <p>
      This project encapsulates all these very similar but still different
      HTTP interfaces and offers simple Ruby interfaces to get real random
      numbers from all the web sites mentioned above.
      </p>
      <h2>Installation</h2>
      <p>
        This library requires at least Ruby 1.8.x.
      </p>
      <p>
      RealRand is available as a Gem and the easiest way to install it is to:
      </p>
      <pre>
      gem install realrand</pre>
      <p>
      If you do not want to use RubyGem you have to
      <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=927&release_id=31330">download</a>
      <em>RealRand</em>. After unpacking the distribution run the following 
      commands from the main directory:
<pre>
  ruby install.rb config
  ruby install.rb setup
  ruby install.rb install</pre>
      </p>
      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>
      Once RealRand is installed and your internet connection is up, generating
      real random numbers is a piece of cake:
<pre>
  require 'random/online'

  generator1 = Random::RandomOrg.new
  puts generator1.randbyte(5).join(",")
  puts generator1.randnum(100, 1, 6).join(",")  # Roll the dice 100 times.
        
  generator2 = Random::FourmiLab.new
  puts generator2.randbyte(5).join(",")
  # randnum is not supported.

  generator3 = Random::EntropyPool.new
  puts generator3.randbyte(5).join(",")
  # randnum is not supported.</pre>
      </p>
      <h2>Limits</h2>
      <p>
      The following limits do apply to the different functions:
      <ul>
        <li><b>RandomOrg#randnum(number = 100, min = 1, max = 100)</b> - You can request
        up to 10,000 random numbers ranging from -1,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,000
        with this method. Of course, <code>max</code> has to be bigger than
        <code>min</code>.</li>
        <li><b>RandomOrg#randbyte(number = 256)</b> - You can request up to 16,384 random
        bytes with this method.</li>
        <li><b>FourmiLab#randbyte(number = 128)</b> - You can request up to 2,048 random
        bytes with this method.</li>
        <li><b>EntropyPool#randbyte(number = 16, limit_result = true)</b> - You can
        request up to 256 random bytes with this method. If there is not enough
        randomness left in the pool, the result will be limited by default,
        i.e. you will get less bytes than requested. If limit_result is set to
        <code>false</code>, then the rest will be generated using a pseudo-random
        generator.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Proxies</h2>
      <p>
      If you have to use a HTTP proxy, you can set it as follows:
<pre>
  require 'random/online'

  generator1 = Random::RandomOrg.new
  generator1.proxy_host = 'your.proxy.here'
  generator1.proxy_port = 8080
  generator1.proxy_usr  = 'your.user.here'
  generator1.proxy_pwd  = 'secret'
  puts generator1.randbyte(5).join(",")
  puts generator1.randnum(100, 1, 6).join(",")  # Roll the dice 100 times.</pre>
      </p>
      <h2>Important Note</h2>
      All the services used in this library are offered for free by their
      maintainers. So, PLEASE, have a look at their web sites and obey to their
      rules, if you use their service.
